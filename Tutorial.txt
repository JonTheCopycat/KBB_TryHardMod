=================== About Movement:
- Command Dash:
	Forward > Down > Down-Forward
	Doing so gives you access to at least 3 moves in A, B and C.
	You can:
		* Jump out of Command Dash. This will do a hyperhop
		* Dash out of Command Dash
		* Do supers while Command Dashing
		* Command Dash Cancel During Starburst.


- Hyperhop:
	Down > Up  - or - Jump out of Command Dash
	You will jump lower than usual, but doing this with Up-Forward or Up-back will allow you to jump with great horizontal speed


- Soft Fastfall:
	You can do a soft fastfall with every character. 
	When ever you're not going up in the air, you can press down at any time and you will fall faster.

Important tip for newbies:
It may be your first time encountering inputs like these, and they can feel too hard or too fast. Remember:
	* Practice makes perfect: Start doing the inputs slowly, then speed up slowly.
	* Practice on both sides. The input will feel different.
	* Take breaks. Your hands do most of their learning during them, so don't rush to learn it in one go.
	* Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast. Even once you have the input down, don't rush it.

=================== About Defense:
The mod contains defense that was been heavily modified from vanilla.

- Counter? no, Shield
	* The counter button has been renamed the guard button
	* It now activates your shield, guarding all incoming highs and lows automatically.

- But... Counter? Okay
	* You can still use counter by pressing Forward + Shield.

- Also Guard Cancel. Use it.
	* Guard cancel is less expensive and more useful now, but more reactable and more vulnerable.

Reminder: Inputs for guard cancel are Shield + Charge during block.
	* guard cancel turns around automatically for crossups, but it can be hit once the attack comes out.
