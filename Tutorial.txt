Inputs to wavedash
	Forward > Down > Down-Forward
	Doing so gives you access to at least 3 moves in A, B and C.

You can:
	* Jump out of wavedash. This will do a hyperhop
	* Dash out of wavedash
	* Wavedash a little bit after the start of a wavedash
	* Do supers while wavedashing
	* Wavedash Cancel During Starburst.

Inputs to hyperhop:
	Down > Up
	This input is very fast
	You will jump lower than usual, but doing this with Up-Forward or Up-back will allow you to jump with great horizontal speed

You can also do a soft fastfall with every character. When ever you're not going up in the air, you can press down at any time and you will fall faster.
