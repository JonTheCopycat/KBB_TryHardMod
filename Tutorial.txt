Inputs to wavedash
	Forward > Down > Down-Forward
	Doing so gives you access to atleast 3 moves in A, B and C. As part of a new change, some characters are starting to have moves in Powercharge, Grab, or Counter as well.

You can:
	* jump out of wavedash. This will do a hyperhop
	* dash out of wavedash
	* wavedash a little bit after the start of a wavedash
	* not do supers while wavedashing
	* **NEW** Wavedash Cancel During Starburst.

You can consistently do QCF supers by inputing them as Halfcircles instead.

Inputs to hyperhop:
	Down > Up
	This input is very fast
	You will jump lower than usual, but doing this with Up-Forward or Up-back will allow you to jump with great horizontal speed

You can also do a soft fastfall with every character. When ever you're not going up in the air, you can press down at ANY time and you will fall faster.
