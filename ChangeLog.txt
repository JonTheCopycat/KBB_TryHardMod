1. New Mechanic: Instant Wavedash = Pressing Down + Fwd after performing a hard fastfall will input a wavedash as soon as you land


Jay:

1. 6C Animation Adjusted


Clutch: 	This character had some potential, but he didn't a good way to go into wavedash in side of common comboes. In addition, his wavedash moves need to be more useful in general. I addressed one of those moves atleast. 

1. 2A: Added Wavedash Cancel on hit.
2. Wavedash C: Startup Reduced (5 frames -> 3 frames)


Fly: 	I just wanted his comboes to be more consistent

1. 5AAA: No longer requires all hits to connect to be cancellable. If any of the kicks hits, it is cancellable.
